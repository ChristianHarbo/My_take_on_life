# My_take_on_life

Her is a big updated.
Now the program will run the "Game" in a separate window with graphics.
But there is one hiccup, it will only work in Microsoft Windows. But it can be corrected with exchange line 42 in MyPanel class with "enemy = new ImageIcon("pixel\picture\Life.png").getImage();" the it will run in Linux but not in windows.
